# Event Ticketing & Booking System Using Clean

# Architecture and Domain-Driven Design

## 1. Project Overview

In this project, students will develop an Event Ticketing & Booking System. The system allows
event organizers to create and publish events, customers to book and pay for tickets, gate
officers to validate tickets during check-in, and administrators to manage refund payout.

This project must be implemented using Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design
tactical patterns. Students are free to choose the programming language, framework, and
platform, but the database must use PostgreSQL.

The project will be developed in pairs using a pair programming approach.

## 2. Learning Objectives

After completing this project, students are expected to be able to:

1. Design software using Clean Architecture with clear separation between domain,
    application, infrastructure, and presentation layers.
2. Implement domain logic using DDD tactical patterns, including aggregate, entity,
    value object, domain service, domain event, factory, and repository.
3. Implement use cases using commands, queries, command handlers, and query
    handlers.


4. Define application service interfaces for external systems and provide their
    implementations in the infrastructure layer.
5. Implement REST API controllers in the presentation layer.
6. Persist aggregate data using PostgreSQL.
7. Write unit tests for domain logic.
8. Create a ubiquitous language glossary for the problem domain.

## 3. System Context

The system interacts with several external actors and external systems.

**Human Actors:**

**Event Organizer**

The Event Organizer can:

- create events
- manage ticket categories
- publish or cancel events
- approve or reject refund requests
- view sales reports
- view participant lists

**Customer**

The Customer can:

- browse available events
- view event details
- create ticket bookings
- pay for bookings
- view purchased tickets
- request refunds

**Gate Officer**

The Gate Officer can:

- validate ticket codes
- check in participants during an event

**System Admin**

The System Admin can:


- trigger refund payout
- monitor operational processes

**External Systems:**

The system may interact with:

1. Payment Gateway. Used to process booking payments.
2. Refund Payment Service / Bank Service. Used to process refund payout to
    customers.
3. Notification Service. Used to send email or WhatsApp notifications.

These external systems must be accessed through application service interfaces defined in
the application layer. Their actual implementations must be placed in the infrastructure
layer.

## 4. Required User Stories

Students must implement the following minimum user stories.

## 9. Final Note

This project is not a simple CRUD application. Students are expected to demonstrate the
ability to design and implement business logic using clean software construction principles.
The main focus is not only whether the application works, but also whether the internal
structure is maintainable, testable, and aligned with Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven
Design.
